      <h1>the awareness initiative</h1>
      <div class="p">The best and worst part of fashion is that there are no rules. There's always a history behind you to acknowledge, learn from, and build off,
        but you also don't want to follow the blueprint too closely. Every generation progresses by questioning tradition, reinterpreting established practice, and adding its voice and style.
        It also takes guts to forge new territory and say no to best practices. Don't care about the industry respect. Do everything in your power to overcome them.
        If you play by their rules, they'll never let you win. There are always a million solutions for every problem; it just depends on how you look at it.
        So much of fashion and life is about perspective--they way you frame and reframe a question to find your solution.</div>
      <div class="p">Nevertheless, designers and artists today are obsessed with peer review. They need the validation of to continue.
        We're talking hacking the algorithm, dressing the "influencer," and assuaging the masses. Instead of carving out a niche, the next generation of entrepreneurs is glomming on to the masses.
        They aren't defining a world for themselves. They are molding themselves to the world. More than ever, there is an importance of thinking outside the box in regard to design, marketing, sales, and all other aspects of business.
        Most important, think outside the box of your own passions. The lesson here? Always draw outside the lines of your dreams.</div>
      <div class="p">The fastest way to grow is by leaving your comfort zone. You gotta stay uncomfortable, constantly adjusting to new contexts,
        shuffling life's Rubik's Cube around in your hands and studying it from all angles. If you're at ease, if the answers are on your dinner plate every night, you'll get lazy.
        You'll stop listening to yourself, which can be fatal, and you'll stop learning, which is even worse. If you're challenged, you'll exercise your brain in creative ways.
        You have to persist and adapt. The goal is to uncork yourself from the center of the universe.</div>
      <div class="p">Fashion rewards brands that can endure through the peaks and valleys of relevance. When you boil it down, it's all about how many times you can say no.
        It's a discipline. You have to train yourself to be comfortable with this word. If you're greedy and profit-driven, that means saying no to an easy and available check.
        If you're a people pleasure, prepare yourself to hurt feelings, be the asshole, and defend your brand against the interests of others.</div>
      <div class="p">As consumers and purveyors, the future of branding lies in genuinely bridging the gaps that divide people.
        This is something streetwear has always inherently achieved. Because it's youth driven, streetwear is full of passion, and adverse to plastic marketing campaigns.
        Streetwear is transparent and purposeful by design, not financial incentive. It's brave and invincible.
        It's foolish and urgent, but that's forever been part of what attracts people to a cause.</div>
      <div class="p">Fashion is funny because as unique as they strive to be, consumers ultimately want to swing in the same direction,
        but there are always black sheep running toward the other end of the pendulum's arc, in defiance of the establishment, championing independent thought.</div>
      <div class="p">Fashion is a room of mirrors, an infinite reaction to itself, and so is business, really. Fashion can be charted as a series of wins and losses: THRIVE. SURVIVE. THRIVE. SURVIVE.
        The hard part is you don't know when the next sentence begins. But the longer you stick around, the sharper you can correct course when it does.</div>
